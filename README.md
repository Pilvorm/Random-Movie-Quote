## Backstory
Making a random quote machine/generator is the first project offered to complete the [freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/). To make it a little different, I created a [gist](https://gist.github.com/Pilvorm/f1aba266bafb87402fe944c0ff6baf04) full of movie quotes including the movie's images!

## Development
This project was made with:
- HTML
- SCSS
- jQuery
- Bootstrap Icons

With contents taken from:
- [JSON Gist](https://gist.github.com/Pilvorm/f1aba266bafb87402fe944c0ff6baf04) 


Challenges:
- Most of the script codes were taken from the [project example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ).
- Learned how to access a public gist and access json files through jQuery
- Background images take a few seconds to load since they are accessed through online websites, not local files.
